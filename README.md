Reverse engineered schematics for the Charon User Interface for Frigidaire induction ranges.

I've also provided a project-specific library which must be imported for the custom 7-segment display symbols. (Was too lazy to scour Google.)

## Feel free to repair or re-use your boards using these schematics.
